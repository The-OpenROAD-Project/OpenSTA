This file summarizes STA API changes for each release.

Release 2.0.18 2020/02/15
-------------------------

The following iterator functions are deprecated:

 TimingArcSet::timingArcIterator()
 Sdc::clockIterator()

Use the iterator class constructor instead. This avoids new/deletes of
the iterators by stack allocating them. For example,
Instead of

  TimingArcSetArcIterator *arc_iter = arc_set->timingArcIterator();
  while (arc_iter->hasNext()) {
    TimingArc *arc = arc_iter->next();
  }
  delete arc_iter;

use the following:

  TimingArcSetArcIterator arc_iter(arc_set);
  while (arc_iter.hasNext()) {
    TimingArc *arc = arc_iter.next();
  }

StaException renamed to Exception
