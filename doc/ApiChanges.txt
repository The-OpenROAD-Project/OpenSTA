This file summarizes STA API changes for each release.

Release 2.1.1 2020/12/13
Report::error, Report::warn functions now take a unique message ID as a first argument.
InternalError has been renamed Report::cricical.

Release 2.1.0 2020/04/05

All public headers files have been moved to include/sta.

The following iterators have been removed.
Use range iteration on the returned collection shown next to them instead.
  LibertyCellInternalPowerIterator cell->internalPowers()
  LibertyCellLeakagePowerIterator cell->leakagePowers()

Release 2.0.18 2020/02/15
-------------------------

The following iterator functions are deprecated:

 TimingArcSet::timingArcIterator()
 Sdc::clockIterator()

Use the iterator class constructor instead. This avoids new/deletes of
the iterators by stack allocating them. For example,
Instead of

  TimingArcSetArcIterator *arc_iter = arc_set->timingArcIterator();
  while (arc_iter->hasNext()) {
    TimingArc *arc = arc_iter->next();
  }
  delete arc_iter;

use the following:

  TimingArcSetArcIterator arc_iter(arc_set);
  while (arc_iter.hasNext()) {
    TimingArc *arc = arc_iter.next();
  }

StaException renamed to Exception

Release 2.0.17 2019/11/11
-------------------------

Network::setVertexIndex renamed to setVertexId
Network::vertexIndex renamed to vertexId

TransRiseFall renamed to RiseFall
TransRiseFallBoth renamed to RiseFallBoth

Release 2.0.0 2018/06/11
-------------------------

Initial release.
