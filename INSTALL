Builds are supported by dist tarfiles or from the git repository.
Building from a dist tarfile does not require the GNU Autotools, Bison
or Flex to be installed and is the recommended method unless you are a
developer.

Builds are also supported with cmake described later in this file.
Autotools based builds are currently supported for compatibility but
are deprecated.

Building from a tarfile
-----------------------

The build dependency versions are show below.  Other versions may
work, but these are the versions used for development.

         from   Ubuntu  Xcode
                18.04.1  10.1
clang    9.1.0           10.0.0
gcc      3.3.2   7.3.0   
tcl      8.2     8.6     8.6.6

These packages are optional:

libz     1.1.4   1.2.5     1.2.8
cudd             2.4.1     3.0.0

Use the following commands to unpack the dist file and compile it.

  tar zvfz opensta-<version>.tgz
  cd opensta-<version>
  ./configure [options...]
  make

With no options, configure builds an optimized executable.
The resulting executable is app/sta.

configure options:
  -h, --help              display configure help and exit
  --enable-debug          enable debug
  --enable-asan           enable AddressSanitizer
  --enable-gprof          enable gprof profiling
  --enable-gcov           enable gcov profiling
  --enable-32bit          force 32 bit compile
  --with-include=dirs     directories to search for include files
  --with-lib=dirs         directories to search for libraries
  --with-tcl=dirs         directories to search for Tcl init files
  --with-cudd=path        use Cudd BDD package, defaults to $CUDD
  --with-visualstudio     use Microcruft Visual Studio C++ compiler

CUDD is a BDD package that is used to improve conditional timing arc
handling.  It is available here:

 https://www.davidkebo.com/source/cudd_versions/cudd-3.0.0.tar.gz
 https://sourceforge.net/projects/cudd-mirror/

Note that the file hierarchy of the CUDD installation changed with
version 3.0. This build only supports the 3.0 layout but only small
changes to configure.ac are required to support older versions.

The Zlib library is an optional.  If the configure script finds libz,
OpenSTA can read Verilog, SDF, SPF, and SPEF files compressed with
gzip.

If the configure script fails to find any of the TCL, Zlib or CUDD
files, use the --with-include, --with-lib, --with-tcl, --with-cudd
options to add directories to search for the files.

The configure -help option lists the generic configure options that
are not described above.  The default arguments to configure disable
shared libraries. To build with shared libraries use the
--enable-shared option.

Building from the git repository
--------------------------------

Building from the git repository has the additional build dependencies
shown below.

         from   Ubuntu  Xcode
                18.04.1  10.1
autoconf 2.53    2.69    2.69
automake 1.6.3   1.15.1  1.16.1
libtool  1.4.2   2.4.6   2.4.6
swig     1.3.28  3.0.12  3.0.12
bison    1.35    3.0.4   2.3
flex     2.5.4   2.6.4   2.5.35

These packages are optional:

gdb      5.3     8.1      
lldb     902.0.79.7      1000.11.38.2
valgrind 1.9.6   3.13.0   N/A

Use the following commands to checkout the git repository and compile
it.

  git clone https://xp-dev.com/git/opensta
  git checkout master|branch
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure [options...]
  make

Building with Cmake
-------------------

Building with cmake requires bison and flex.

 git clone https://xp-dev.com/git/opensta
 cd opensta
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ../
 make

The resulting executable is app/sta for compatibility with configure.
The library without main is app/libSTA.a.

Optional cmake variables passed as -D<var>=<value> arguments to cmake.

 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE DEBUG|RELEASE
 TCL_LIB - path to tcl library
 TCL_HEADER - path to tcl.h
 TCL_INIT - path to init.tcl
 CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

If TCL_LIB is specified the cmake script will attempt to locate
the header and init files from its path.

Default install directory is /usr/local.
To install in a different directory with cmake use:

 cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix_path>

or use the DESTDIR variable with make.

 make DESTDIR=<prefix_path> install

Building on Windoz
------------------
The Win32 API does not natively support the pthreads API.  The
pthreads-win32 package is one way to get support for pthreads for 32
bit builds.  It is available from www.sourceware.org/pthreads-win32.
If the configure script does not find pthreads.h the build proceeds
without thread support.

Use a .bat file to start a cygwin shell that has its path set to
support the Microcruft cl compiler by calling the vsvars32.bat script
from the Visual C++ installation.

tcsh-startup.bat
  @echo off
  call "c:\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars.bat"
  set path=c:\cygwin\bin;%PATH%
  c:\cygwin\bin\tcsh

Configure and build from the shell. Note that tcl and zlib must be
built with the Visual C++ compiler to link to the sta libraries.

./bootstrap
./configure --with-visualstudio
# Rebuild flex/bison files because include files are different.
make maintainer-clean

Good luck and don't bother me with windoz specific issues.
I am happy to say I haven't owned a windoz machine in 20 years.


Submitting Bug Reports
----------------------
All bug reports should attach a testcase, preferably in the following
form:

 A gzip'd tar file that unpacks into a directory with the same name as the tar file
 A file named README that describes the problem
 All commands in one .tcl file (usually run.tcl) for small cases
 No calls to "exit"
 No shell scripts to envoke the sta.
