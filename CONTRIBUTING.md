# Open STA Contribution Model

OpenSTA is contribution is mediated by the [DCO v1.1](https://developercertificate.org/). 

As such contributors are required to "sign-off" their commits with `git commit -s` command. 
This signifies your agreement to the terms in the afermentioned DCO v1.1

## History

OpenSTA was originally open sourced by *Parallax Software* under the GPL v3.0 license. 
*Parallax Software* is a small business that generously contributed its STA engine so
that the open source hardware community could flourish. *Parallax Software* is still
a thriving business that sells support and proprietary licenses to OpenSTA **(link here to
find more info)**.

As such OpenSTA has historically not allowed external contributors, because accepting a
contribution under the GPL would prevent *Parallax Software* from selling proprietary 
licenses.

## Accepting External Contributions

The DCO v1.1 allows contributors to choose a license if permitted by the upstream project.

```
under the same open source license (unless I am
permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
in the file;
```

In order to allow open source contribution to this project as well as preserve the business
needs of *Parallax Software* we ask that contributors license their contributions under 
Apache 2.0. **Make no mistake OpenSTA remains firmly GPL v3.0, but will have some Apache 2.0
code. Any use will need to comply with both licenses.**

*Parallax Software* employees and officers will continue to be allowed to provide their contributions
under GPL v3.0

Contributions "signed-off" with `git commit -s` are agreeing to license their contributions
under Apache 2.0 under the terms of DCO v1.1, but to ensure clarity we 
ask contributors to acknowledge this document before PRs will be accepted from them.

### Acknowledgements

This acknowledgment is not a legal agreement.
